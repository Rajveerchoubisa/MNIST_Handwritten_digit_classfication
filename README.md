# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates a **handwritten digit classification** system using the MNIST dataset. The model leverages **Deep Learning** and a **Neural Network** architecture to accurately classify digits (0-9) from grayscale images.

## Features
- Built a neural network model for digit classification.
- Achieved high accuracy using techniques like **dropout** and **batch normalization**.
- Utilized **TensorFlow/Keras** for model building and training.
- Visualized training progress with graphs for accuracy and loss.

## Dataset
- The **MNIST dataset** contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
- Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel representation of a single digit.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
